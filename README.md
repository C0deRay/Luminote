# Luminote

Luminote is an electron-based desktop application that leverages the power of C++ for performance-critical tasks. The tech stack for Luminote can be summarized as follows:

- **Electron.js**: Luminote is built using Electron, a popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is the server-side JavaScript runtime used by Electron. It allows Luminote to use JavaScript on the desktop and access the file system, network, and other system resources.

- **React.js**: Luminote's user interface is built using React, a popular front-end JavaScript library for building UIs. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making it easy to manage the complexity of the application's interface.

- **C++**: Luminote uses C++ for performance-critical tasks, such as parsing large files or running complex algorithms. C++ is a powerful language that can interact with the operating system at a low level, making it ideal for tasks that require high performance and low latency.
